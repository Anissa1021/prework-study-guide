# Prework Study Guide

## Description
This site is for me to write down notes as I am learning to build it, I have learned the very, very basics of HTML, CSS, JS, as well as deploying it here on GitHub. I also learned how to link CSS and JS to the HTML page. I found JS to be the most confusing to understand but after a while it started coming to me.

## Installation
